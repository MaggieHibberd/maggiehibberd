I recently finished training at the highly selective Makers Academy programme, starting out as an enthusiastic amateur I have left the academy with a great foundation in test-driven development, object-oriented programming and modern development languages including JavaScript and Ruby. Programming is a continued learning experience from new languages to testing frameworks and  I am excited to turn the page and get stuck into this next chapter of my life! :notebook_with_decorative_cover:
